# TSF-Simple-Banking-System
As part of my internship with The Sparks Foundation, I have completed Task 1 and created a dynamic website for a basic banking system.

Basic Banking System
◇ A simple dynamic website.
◇ A dummy data in database for upto 10 customers. Customers table will have basic fields such as name, email, current balance etc. 
Transfers table will record all transfers happened.
◇ Flow: Home Page > View all Customers > Select and View one Customer > Transfer Money > Select customer to transfer to >View all Customers .
◇ No Login Page. No User Creation. Only transfer of money between multiple users.
